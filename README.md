# yt-playlist
A YouTube playlist downloader. Requires [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pytube](https://github.com/nficano/pytube), and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to work.

This script will download the audio of every song in a YouTube playlist, then convert the audio to mp3. To use, place it in the folder in which you want to download the playlist.

Please let me know if there are any bugs.
